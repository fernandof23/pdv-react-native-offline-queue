/**
 * Custom middleware that can consume the action before it can reach the reducer.
 *
 * This is useful when we want to optimistically update the local state,
 * but the same action will be dispatched again when it is fired from the offline queue.
 * To avoid updating the state again we change its type to one no reducer reacts to.
 *
 * For the action to be consumed it should have:
 * ```
 * consume: true
 * ```
 * property set.
 *
 * Note: For this to work correctly it should be placed as the last middleware in the chain.
 * For example, we do want the saga or logger to react to this action.
